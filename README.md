# Prework Study Guide Website

## Description
This website was made to help boot camp students memorize each of the different HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript lessons that were covered throughout the prework.

### What was your motivation?
There are many other students in the same coding boot camp, and many of those may be new to web design. And for anyone who is just starting out with coding, they will want a website where they can review all the different commands for all the languages used for web design.
### Why did you build this project?
I made this website so other boot camp students can quickly review all the basics about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
### What problem does it solve?
This solves the problem of students not knowing where to get all the information they need for reviewing the basics of web development.
### What did you learn?
I learned how to properly structure this webpage with HTML, how to make it look visually appealing with CSS, and how to make it interactive by using JavaScript. I also learned how to add any changes made to GitHub by using Git commands.
